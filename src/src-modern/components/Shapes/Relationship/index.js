// Default export - this is what you get when you import Relationship
export { default } from './Relationship';

// Named exports - if you want to import specific components directly
// Uncomment these if you need to use these components elsewhere
// export { default as ChildRelationship } from './ChildRelationship';
// export { default as RelationshipDragHandle } from './RelationshipDragHandle';

// Note: Since ChildRelationship and RelationshipDragHandle are only used
// internally by the main Relationship component, we typically don't export them.
// Only export what needs to be used by other components.
